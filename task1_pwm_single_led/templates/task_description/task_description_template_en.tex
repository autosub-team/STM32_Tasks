\section*{Task {{TASKNR}}: Controlling an LED using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)}

Your task is to control one of the available LEDs on the adapter board for the Nucleo board using the capture/compare modules of a timer. Use the information in the datasheet \cite{data_sheet} and reference manual \cite{ref_manual} of the STM32F334 as well as the user manual for the Nucleo-64 board \cite{nucleo_manual} and the description of the LL driver \cite{driver_manual}. Also use the already prepared file \enquote{pwm\_single\_led.c} and note the following specifications for your solution:

\begin{itemize}
\item Frequency at which the LED should blink: $f_{PWM}$= {{FRQ}}\,Hz ($=\frac{1}{T_{PWM}}$)
\item Duty cycle: $\frac{T_{HIGH}}{T_{PWM}}$ = {{DUTY}}\,\%
\item Pin to be controlled (and thus the specified LED): {{PIN}}
\item Timer/Channel to be used: {{CHANNEL}}
\item The rising edge (change to High) of the signal should be kept constant and the falling edge (change to Low) should be modulated accordingly.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.3cm}

The capture/compare channels of the specific timer must be used. Solutions that use any delays or interrupt routines will not be accepted as a solution.
\\

\fbox{\parbox{\linewidth}{Attention: Timers 16 and 17 have complementary (N) channels, which together with the regular channels and the introduction of a dead-time, ensure a defined sequence of e.g. switching signals. For this reason, with these timers, another bit (the MOE-bit) in the TIMx\_BDTR register must be set to generate an output. Use the command \enquote{LL\_TIM\_EnableAllOutputs(TIMx)} for this purpose if you are to use one of the two timers and after you have configured the timer.}}
\\

Program the above-defined behavior in the attached file \enquote{pwm\_single\_led.c}.
\\

To submit your solution, send an email with the subject \enquote{Result Task {{ TASKNR }}} and your file \enquote{pwm\_single\_led.c} to {{ SUBMISSIONEMAIL }}.

Good luck and may the force be with you.
